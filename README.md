#IP Monitor

Created this plugin just for fun and for my personal development. The idea came from the persisten spamming from robots on the websites I manage. This is supposed to bring a solution to my web bots problem

## Avoiding database usage if possible
Will be using JSON instead of the sites database to reduce queries. IPs are not generally something to keep for ever in this case.

### Status
